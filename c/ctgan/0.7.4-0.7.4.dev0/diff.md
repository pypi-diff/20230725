-## v0.3.0 - 2020-12-18 In this release we add a new TVAE model which was
-presented in the original CTGAN paper. It also exposes more hyperparameters and
-moves epochs and log_frequency from fit to the constructor. A new verbose
-argument has been added to optionally disable unnecessary printing, and a new
-hyperparameter called `discriminator_steps` has been added to CTGAN to control
-the number of optimization steps performed in the discriminator for each
-generator epoch. The code has also been reorganized and cleaned up for better
-readability and interpretability. Special thanks to @Baukebrenninkmeijer

-## v0.3.0 - 2020-12-18 In this release we add a new TVAE model which was
-presented in the original CTGAN paper. It also exposes more hyperparameters and
-moves epochs and log_frequency from fit to the constructor. A new verbose
-argument has been added to optionally disable unnecessary printing, and a new
-hyperparameter called `discriminator_steps` has been added to CTGAN to control
-the number of optimization steps performed in the discriminator for each

+github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/54) by @fealho ### Bugs fixed * Fixed NaN !=
+NaN counting bug. - [Issue #100](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/100)
+by @fealho * Update dependencies and testing - [Issue #90](https://github.com/
+sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/90) by @csala ## v0.2.2 - 2020-11-13 In this release we
+introduce several minor improvements to make CTGAN more versatile and propertly
+support new types of data, such as categorical NaN values, as well as
+conditional sampling and features to save and load models. Additionally, the
+dependency ranges and python versions have been updated to support up to date
+runtimes. Many thanks @fealho @leix28 @csala @oregonpillow and @lurosenb for
+working on making this release possible! ### Improvements * Drop Python 3.5
+support - [Issue #79](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/79) by @fealho *
+Support NaN values in categorical variables - [Issue #78](https://github.com/
+sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/78) by @fealho * Sample synthetic data conditioning on a
+discrete column - [Issue #69](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/69) by
+@leix28 * Support recent versions of pandas - [Issue #57](https://github.com/
+sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/57) by @csala * Easy solution for restoring original
+dtypes - [Issue #26](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/26) by
+@oregonpillow ### Bugs fixed * Loss to nan - [Issue #73](https://github.com/
+sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/73) by @fealho * Swapped the sklearn utils testing import
+statement - [Issue #53](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/53) by
+@lurosenb ## v0.2.1 - 2020-01-27 Minor version including changes to ensure the
+logs are properly printed and the option to disable the log transformation to
+the discrete column frequencies. Special thanks to @kevinykuo for the
+contributions! ### Issues Resolved: * Option to sample from true data frequency
+instead of logged frequency - [Issue #16](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/
+issues/16) by @kevinykuo * Flush stdout buffer for epoch updates - [Issue #14]
